<h1>About us</h1>
<p class="glassy">On average Make-A-Wish grants approximately 1,000 wishes per year. In the 2022/23 financial year we're on track to grant over 1,200 wishes and hoping to increase this number in future years.
Inevitably, wishes do cost money though and we rely on people like you to raise the funds we need to grant those wishes. We also invest in fundraising to ensure that there is enough money available to grant the wishes of the children who will turn to us in the future.
For every £1 we spend on fundraising, we generate £2.22 of income*.
We also seek to generate support through offers of gifts in kind, which reduces our dependency on cash donations and will ultimately help us to increase the number of wishes we are able to grant. In 2021/22 we generated gift in kind support to the value of £1.46m*.</p>
