<h1>Our Mission</h1>

<div class="glassy">
  <p>
  Right now over 134,000 children in the UK are dealing with the gruelling daily reality of life with a critical illness. When it comes to their dreams, they deserve to wish for more than a life defined by their illness.
  </p>

  <p>Critical illness brings a child’s joy to an abrupt end but Make-A-Wish UK is part of a global movement that grants life-changing wishes that have the power to turn tears into cheers, rescuing the magic of childhood even in their toughest times and providing a lifeline for families to spend precious time together.</p>
